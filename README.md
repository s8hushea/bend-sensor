# bend-sensor

Welcome to my "Back Bend Sensor"'s repo.

Project Overview:
This project aims to build a textile bend sensor that reads bendings levels of your back. Most material can be found home at most times, and others are cheap to get. 

Repo Layout:
-In the Progress folder you'll find a text file named Status.txt, where you can find the next step in our plan.
-In the Resources folder you'll find the sketch of the project and the plan for building the sensor.
-In the Tests folder you'll find in the future test scenarios where we can check the functionality of the sensor once it is built.
